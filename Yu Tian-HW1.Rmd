## Question 1:

Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?

#### Answer
Supervised learning: 
The actual data Y is the supervisor, so the response is known. It need to give the model observed output and input. The specific step is prediction (accurately predict future response given predictors), estimation (understand how predictors affect response), model selection (find the "best" model for response given predictors), inference (assess the quality of our predictions and (or) estimation).
It can show the linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, support vector machine(s), neural network.

Unsupervised learning: 
Learn without the supervisor, so the response is not known.
It can show that Principal Component Analysis(PCA), k-means clusting, Hierarchical clustering, neural networks.

The difference is that supervised learning with known response, but unsupervised learning with unknown response. 


## Question 2:

Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.

#### Answer



## Question 3:
Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.

#### Answer


## Question 4:
As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

#### Answer
Descriptive models:
Descriptive models will be chose to best visually emphasize a trend in data, like using a line on a scatterplot.

Inferential models:

Predictive models:


## Question 5:
Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

a) Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?

b) In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

c) Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.

#### Answer


## Question 6:
A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.

#### Answer


## Exercise 1:
We are interested in highway miles per gallon, or the hwy variable. Create a histogram of this variable. Describe what you see/learn.

#### Answer
```{r}
hist(mpg$hwy, main = "Histogram of hwy", xlab = "highway miles per gallon", ylab = "the number of cars")
```



## Exercise 2:
Create a scatterplot. Put hwy on the x-axis and cty on the y-axis. Describe what you notice. Is there a relationship between hwy and cty? What does this mean?

#### Answer



## Exercise 3:
Make a bar plot of manufacturer. Flip it so that the manufacturers are on the y-axis. Order the bars by height. Which manufacturer produced the most cars? Which produced the least?

#### Answer


## Exercise 4:
Make a box plot of hwy, grouped by cyl. Do you see a pattern? If so, what?

#### Answer


## Exercise 5:
Use the corrplot package to make a lower triangle correlation matrix of the mpg dataset. (Hint: You can find information on the package here.)

Which variables are positively or negatively correlated with which others? Do these relationships make sense to you? Are there any that surprise you?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
